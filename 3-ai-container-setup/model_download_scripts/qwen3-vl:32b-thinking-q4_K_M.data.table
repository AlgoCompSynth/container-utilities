Thinking...
We are going to use the data.table package to read a CSV file.
 Steps:
 1. Make sure the data.table package is installed (if not, we can install it, but typically in a script we assume it's installed or we can use tryCatch for installation? However, the problem doesn't require installation, so we assume it's installed).
 2. Load the data.table package.
 3. Read the CSV file 'offices.csv' into a data.table named 'offices'.

 Note: The problem does not specify the path, so we assume the file is in the working directory.

 Let's write the code accordingly.
...done thinking.

To read the CSV file `offices.csv` into a data.table named `offices`, follow these steps using the `data.table` package:

1. **Install and load the `data.table` package** (if not already installed).
2. **Read the CSV file** into a data.table using `fread()`.

Here's the concise R program:

```r
# Ensure data.table is installed (uncomment if needed)
# install.packages("data.table")

# Load the data.table package
library(data.table)

# Read the CSV file into a data.table named 'offices'
offices <- fread("offices.csv")
```

### Explanation:
- **`fread()`** is the recommended function for reading CSV files in `data.table` because it is **faster** and **more efficient** than base R's `read.csv()`.
- The file path `"offices.csv"` is assumed to be in your **current working directory**. If it's elsewhere, provide the full path (e.g., `"data/offices.csv"`).
- The result is stored in the variable `offices`, which will be a `data.table` object.

### Example Output (if you want to verify):
```r
# Print the first few rows
head(offices)
```

This solution efficiently loads your data while leveraging `data.table`'s performance optimizations.
