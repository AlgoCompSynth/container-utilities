Thinking...
1.  **Analyze the Request:**
    *   **Language:** ChucK (a strong-typed, real-time audio programming language).
    *   **Goal:** Send sound to the DAC.
    *   **Parameters:**
        *   Duration: 1 second.
        *   Frequency: Middle C.
        *   Waveform: Triangle.

2.  **Identify Key ChucK Concepts/Functions:**
    *   **DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter):** The `dac` object.
    *   **Oscillators:** The `SinOsc` is the standard sine wave, but the prompt asks for a *triangle* wave.
        *   ChucK has a built-in `TriOsc`.
    *   **Envelope/ADSR:** To control the gain (amplitude) smoothly (to avoid clicking), an `Env` object is usually best. However, for a simple "send a sound" task, a constant gain is acceptable, but an envelope is more professional. Let's stick to the simplest valid implementation first, maybe adding an envelope as an optional "pro" tip, but strictly following the prompt means getting the sound out.
        *   *Self-Correction:* A triangle wave going straight to max amplitude often causes a click at the start and end if not ramped. An `ADSR` envelope is the standard ChucK way to do this.
    *   **Timing:** ChucK has time (`now`, `second`).
    *   **Frequency Calculation:** Middle C is typically defined as 440Hz? No, Middle C (C4) is 261.63 Hz.
    *   **Duration:** 1 second (`1000::ms` or `1::second`).

3.  **Drafting the Code (Mental or Scratchpad):**

    *   *Step 1: Setup*
        ```chuck
        // dac is usually the default output device
        // no specific setup needed usually
        ```

    *   *Step 2: The Oscillator*
        ```chuck
        TriOsc t => dac; // TriOsc connects directly to DAC
        ```

    *   *Step 3: Frequency*
        ```chuck
        261.63 => t.freq;
        ```

    *   *Step 4: Amplitude (Envelope)*
        To make it 1 second, I need an envelope. A simple linear ramp works.
        ```chuck
        Env e => Gain g;
        g => dac; // We can attach gain to dac, or attach TriOsc to Gain.
        // Actually, usually Oscillator -> Gain -> DAC is easier for amplitude control.
        // Or Oscillator -> DAC, Gain -> DAC? No.
        // Best practice: Oscillator -> Envelope -> Gain -> DAC? Or Oscillator -> Gain -> DAC?
        // Let's go with: TriOsc -> Envelope -> Gain -> DAC.
        // Wait, the prompt just says "send to DAC". If I do Osc -> DAC, it's loud.
        ```
        Let's try the simplest approach first: `TriOsc` -> `Gain` -> `dac`.
        But `Gain` usually needs a connection to `dac` to actually be heard.

        *Revised Plan:*
        `TriOsc t => Gain g => dac;`
        `261.63 => t.freq;`
        `0.5 => g.gain;` (Set a moderate volume)

        *Handling the 1-second duration:*
        How to stop after 1 second?
        ```chuck
        1000::ms => now;
        ```
        Wait, if I just put `1000::ms => now;` at the end of the code, it stops the program. That works, but it's a bit abrupt.

        *Better Plan (Envelope):*
        Use an envelope to ramp amplitude up and down.
        `Env e => Gain g => dac;`
        `TriOsc t => g;` (Connect osc to gain)
        `261.63 => t.freq;`
        `e.set(0, 0, 0.8, 0.8);` // Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release (0.8s attack, 0.2s decay)
        `e.keyOn();`
        `1000::ms => now;`
        `e.keyOff();`

        *Simpler Plan (Linear Ramp for Volume):*
        `Gain g => dac;`
        `TriOsc t => g;`
        `261.63 => t.freq;`
        `0.8 => g.gain;`
        `1000::ms => now;`
        `0.0 => g.gain;` // Turn off
        `100::ms => now;` // Fade out
        This is cleaner than ADSR if we don't need sustain.

4.  **Refining the Code:**

    *   *Frequency:* 261.63 Hz is standard for Middle C.
    *   *Oscillator:* `TriOsc`.
    *   *DAC:* `dac`.

    *Drafting the specific snippet:*
    ```chuck
    // Create a gain node connected to DAC
    Gain g => dac;

    // Create a triangle oscillator connected to Gain
    TriOsc t => g;

    // Set frequency to Middle C
    261.63 => t.freq;

    // Set volume (0.5 is reasonable)
    0.5 => g.gain;

    // Wait for 1 second
    1000::ms => now;
    ```
    *Critique:* This simply plays the note, but it stops abruptly at 1 second because the program ends. It doesn't ramp the volume down. This is usually acceptable for a basic "send X" task, but ramping down prevents "clicking".

    Let's provide the version with an envelope for robustness, as ChucK is used for audio generation, and "crunchy" starts/stops are bad form.

    *Envelope Version:*
    ```chuck
    // Setup DAC
    dac => NRev n => Gain g => dac; // Adding a slight reverb effect makes it sound "done" and natural, but maybe overkill. Let's skip reverb.

    // Setup Envelope
    Env e => g;

    // Oscillator
    TriOsc t => g;

    // Settings
    261.63 => t.freq;
    e.set(0.01, 0, 0.5, 0.01); // Quick attack, no decay, moderate sustain, quick release
    e.keyOn();

    // Timing
    1000::ms => now;
    e.keyOff();
    ```

    *Simple Version:*
    ```chuck
    TriOsc s => dac;
    261.63 => s.freq;
    0.5 => s.gain;
    1000::ms => now;
    ```
    The prompt is very specific: "send a one-second middle C triangle wave". The simplest correct answer is usually best.

5.  **Finalizing the Code Structure:**

    I will provide a clean, robust solution.
    1. Define `TriOsc`.
    2. Connect to `Gain`.
    3. Connect `Gain` to `dac`.
    4. Set Frequency (261.63Hz).
    5. Set Gain.
    6. Wait for 1000ms.

    *Wait, `TriOsc` can be connected directly to `dac`.*
    `TriOsc t => dac;`
    `t.freq(261.63);`
    `1000::ms => now;`

    This is the absolute minimal code.

    However, `Gain` allows volume control which is safer. I will use the `Gain` approach as it's standard practice.

    *Let's double check ChucK syntax:*
    - `TriOsc t;` (Declaration)
    - `t => Gain g => dac;` (Connection)
    - `261.63 => t.freq;` (Assignment)
    - `0.5 => g.gain;` (Assignment)
    - `1000::ms => now;` (Timing)

6.  **Constructing the Final Output:**

    I will add comments explaining what each part does.

    ```chuck
    // Connect the TriOsc oscillator to a Gain node
    // Connect the Gain node to the DAC
    TriOsc t => Gain g => dac;

    // Set frequency to Middle C (approx 261.63 Hz)
    261.63 => t.freq;

    // Set volume to 50% (0.5 is a safe default volume)
    0.5 => g.gain;

    // Wait for 1 second
    1000::ms => now;

    // Optional: Turn off the gain to prevent clicking
    0.0 => g.gain;
    ```

    This looks correct and meets all criteria. I will present this version.

7.  **Alternative "Envelope" approach:**
    Many users prefer an envelope for a 1-second sound so it fades out rather than cutting out. I'll include a comment or a slight variation, but the code block above is the most direct answer. Actually, adding an envelope makes the code longer. I'll stick to the gain ramp for simplicity unless the user asked for "smooth". The prompt didn't ask for "smooth". I will stick to the simple version.

    *Wait*, looking at ChucK examples, `ADSR` is the standard way to handle time envelopes. If I use an ADSR, I don't need the `1000::ms => now` command because the `keyOff` handles the release.
    Let's stick to the manual timing (`1000::ms => now`) as it explicitly satisfies the "one-second" requirement explicitly in code logic, rather than relying on the envelope release time.

    Final Code Check:
    ```chuck
    TriOsc s => dac;
    261.63 => s.freq;
    0.5 => s.gain;
    1000::ms => now;
    ```
    This is technically valid, but `Gain` is better practice than modifying `dac` directly.

    Let's write the response.
...done thinking.

Here is the ChucK code to achieve this.

```chuck
// Create a Triangle Oscillator connected to a Gain node
// The Gain node connects to the DAC (Output)
TriOsc t => Gain g => dac;

// Set the frequency to Middle C (approx 261.63 Hz)
261.63 => t.freq;

// Set the volume to 50%
0.5 => g.gain;

// Wait for 1 second
1000::ms => now;

// (Optional) Turn off the gain to prevent clicking artifacts
0.0 => g.gain;
```

### Explanation:
1.  **`TriOsc t`**: Instantiates a triangle wave oscillator.
2.  **`=>`**: The `=>` operator in ChucK is used for signal routing (data flow).
3.  **`=> dac`**: Routes the signal to the computer's audio output (DAC).
4.  **`261.63 => t.freq;`**: Sets the frequency to 261.63 Hz, which is the standard pitch for Middle C.
5.  **`1000::ms => now;`**: Pauses the program execution for 1 second (1000 milliseconds), ensuring the sound plays for that duration.
6.  **`0.0 => g.gain;`**: While optional, setting the gain to 0 after the sound stops prevents any audio clicks that might occur if the oscillator stops abruptly.
