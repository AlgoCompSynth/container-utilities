Thinking...
The user wants a ChucK program.
The requirements are:
1.  Send sound to the DAC.
2.  Waveform type: Triangle.
3.  Duration: One second.
4.  Pitch: Middle C.

Step 1: Determine Middle C frequency.
Middle C (C4) is $261.626 \text{ Hz}$.

Step 2: Determine the main object.
To generate sound and send it to the DAC in ChucK, I need an oscillator object.
Common oscillators: `SinOsc`, `SawOsc`, `TriOsc`, `SquareOsc`.
The requirement specifies "triangle wave", so I will use `TriOsc`.

Step 3: Connect to the output.
`TriOsc` needs to be connected to an `UGen` (Unit Generator).
To connect to the DAC (output), I use `=> dac`.

Step 4: Control the frequency.
`TriOsc` has an `@.freq()` method (or `.freq()` depending on the syntax version, usually `.freq()` for assignment).
So, `myOsc.freq(261.63);`.

Step 5: Control the duration and envelope.
The prompt asks to send a *one-second* wave. This implies an envelope, otherwise, it will just start and keep playing or stop abruptly.
However, simple ChucK programs often use `1 :: second` as a time duration for `me.me` (the current object's `.me` method) to stop the current thread after that time.
Or, I can use an `ADSR` envelope connected between the oscillator and the DAC to shape the sound, but `me.me` is the standard way to "stop after X seconds" in a one-line script context.

Let's look at the syntax:
```chuck
TriOsc t => NRev r => dac;
t.freq(261.63);
t => blackhole; // Wait for sound to play? No, dac is real output.
```

Actually, the simplest way to send sound for a specific duration is:
```chuck
TriOsc t => dac;
t.freq(261.626); // Middle C
1 :: second => now;
```

Is this sufficient?
`TriOsc` has a default phase, so it might click. `TriOsc` usually starts at 0. The sound will stop abruptly at 1 second.
If the user wants a *sine* wave to avoid clicking, they would use `SineOsc`. But they asked for `TriOsc`. Clicking is inherent to the waveform type at start/stop without an envelope.

Let's refine the code.

```chuck
// Create a triangle oscillator
TriOsc t => dac;

// Set frequency to Middle C (approx 261.63 Hz)
t.freq(261.63);

// Wait for one second
1 :: second => now;
```

Alternative approach with an ADSR envelope (smoother):
```chuck
TriOsc t => ADSR e => dac;
t.freq(261.63);
e.set(0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 0.1);
e.keyOn();
1 :: second => now;
e.keyOff();
```

The prompt is very specific: "send a one-second triangle wave".
Usually, in these types of homework/interview questions, they look for the shortest, most direct implementation using `TriOsc` and `::`.

Let's stick to the direct implementation.

Code structure:
1. `TriOsc osc => dac;`
2. `osc.freq(261.63);`
3. `1 :: second => now;`

Is there a `blackhole` needed? No, `dac` is the physical output.

Let's double-check Middle C frequency.
A4 is 440Hz.
C4 is A4 * 2^(-9/12) = 440 * 0.5946 = 261.63Hz.

Final check on ChucK syntax.
`TriOsc` -> `TriOsc` object.
`=> dac` -> connects to output.
`freq(261.63)` -> sets frequency.
`1 :: second => now` -> suspends execution for 1 second.

This looks correct.

Let's provide a brief explanation along with the code to be helpful.

The user didn't ask for comments, but code readability is good practice.

```chuck
// Create a triangle oscillator connected to the DAC
TriOsc t => dac;

// Set the frequency to Middle C (approx 261.63 Hz)
t.freq(261.63);

// Wait for one second
1 :: second => now;
```

I will provide this version. It is the standard, most direct answer.
...done thinking.

Here is the ChucK program to generate a triangle wave of Middle C for one second.

```chuck
// Create a triangle oscillator connected to the DAC
TriOsc t => dac;

// Set the frequency to Middle C (approx 261.63 Hz)
t.freq(261.63);

// Wait for one second (suspends execution for the duration)
1 :: second => now;
```

### Explanation:
1.  **`TriOsc t => dac;`**: Instantiates a `TriOsc` (Triangle Oscillator) and pipes it directly to the DAC (`dac`).
2.  **`t.freq(261.63);`**: Sets the frequency to approximately 261.63 Hz, which is the standard pitch for Middle C.
3.  **`1 :: second => now;`**: Tells the current thread to wait for one second before terminating. This ensures the sound plays for exactly that duration.
