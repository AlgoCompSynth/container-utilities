Thinking...
The user wants a ChucK program.
The requirements are:
1.  **Language:** ChucK (a real-time audio programming language).
2.  **Signal:** A triangle wave.
3.  **Duration:** One second.
4.  **Pitch:** Middle C (C4).
5.  **Output:** Send to the DAC (Direct Audio Component).

*Step 1: Initialize the DAC.*
ChucK usually requires a standard setup. The `dac` object handles stereo output, so that's the main one. Often, `Std.mtof()` is used for pitch conversion.

*Step 2: Define the Oscillator.*
I need a triangle wave oscillator. In ChucK, `TriOsc` is the class for a triangle oscillator.
`TriOsc t => dac;` creates a triangle oscillator connected to the dac. However, the prompt says "send... to the DAC". It doesn't strictly imply a one-shot loop *every* time, but "send a one-second triangle wave" implies generating sound for that duration.
Usually, simple ChucK scripts start the engine and then play.

*Step 3: Define the Pitch.*
Middle C is MIDI note 60.
ChucK has `Std.mtof(60)` which converts MIDI note number to frequency.
Frequency of C4 is approximately 261.625 Hz.

*Step 4: Control Timing.*
The prompt asks for "one-second".
I can use the `<<< ... >>>` to print status.
I need a timing mechanism.
Method A: Use `1 :: second => now`. This waits for 1 second.
Method B: Set the duration of a specific UGen or use a time argument, but `1 :: second` is the standard "sleep" command in ChucK to handle timing loops.

*Drafting the Code:*

```chuck
// Initialize the oscillator
TriOsc t => dac;

// Set the pitch (Middle C)
t.freq(Std.mtof(60));

// Trigger a sound. Since it's an oscillator, it needs to be "started".
// Actually, in ChucK, if it's just connected, does it play?
// Usually, oscillators output continuously unless gated. However, in simple "hello world" style scripts, we often just set frequency and maybe leave it running, or trigger a gain envelope.
// But a pure triangle wave at C4 for 1 second implies a note duration.
// Let's assume the user wants the oscillator running at that pitch for 1 second.

// To make it clean:
// 1. Setup dac and triosc.
// 2. Set frequency.
// 3. Wait 1 second.

t.freq(Std.mtof(60));
1 :: second => now;

// Optional: Clean up
// t = null;
// dac = null;
```

*Refining the "Send to DAC" part:*
`TriOsc t => dac;` is the correct syntax.

*Handling the "one-second" constraint:*
Does the user want the code to *only* play for one second and stop? Or just that the *instruction* was for one second?
Usually, if I write `1 :: second => now`, the program pauses for a second.
If the oscillator is still connected to the dac during that pause, the sound will play for a second and then stop (since the `now` command effectively suspends the program flow, but the audio thread continues until disconnected). Actually, in ChucK, if you disconnect the UGen, the sound stops.
If I simply write:
```chuck
TriOsc t => dac;
t.freq(Std.mtof(60));
1 :: second => now;
```
This will output a triangle wave at C4 for 1 second. This is the most robust, simple answer.

*Alternative interpretation:*
Maybe they want a burst?
`TriOsc t => NRev r => dac;` (with gain) -> `t.freq(...)`.
But standard ChucK usage usually assumes continuous streams unless interrupted.

*Let's verify frequency:*
Middle C is C4.
`Std.mtof(60)` returns correct Hz.

*Let's verify the UGen:*
`TriOsc`.

*Code Structure:*
```chuck
// Initialize a triangle oscillator and connect it to the DAC
TriOsc t => dac;

// Set the pitch to Middle C (MIDI note 60)
t.freq(Std.mtof(60));

// Play for one second
1 :: second => now;
```

This looks correct and complete. I will provide this along with a brief explanation of what each part does.

One small detail: `Std.mtof` is standard. `Std.srand(time)` is sometimes good practice to ensure random isn't used, though not strictly necessary here.

Let's double check if `1 :: second => now` is strictly needed.
If I don't put that line, the program waits for input or exits. The sound would likely stop if the garbage collector kicks in or if I disconnect, but simply adding the wait command is the standard way to enforce a duration in a script.

*Final Code Plan:*
```chuck
// Define a triangle oscillator
TriOsc t => dac;

// Set frequency to Middle C (MIDI note 60)
t.freq(Std.mtof(60));

// Hold for one second
1 :: second => now;
```
I will also include comments explaining it.

Wait, is there any ambiguity in "send to the DAC"?
In ChucK, `dac` is the object for audio output.
`TriOsc t => dac;`
This connects the oscillator to the dac.

What if the user wants a one-shot event?
Usually, in ChucK, you'd use `gain` and `=>` chains, but for a simple script, the sleep command is sufficient.

Let's ensure the output format is clear.

```chuck
// Create a triangle oscillator and connect it to the DAC
TriOsc t => dac;

// Set the pitch to Middle C (MIDI note 60)
t.freq(Std.mtof(60));

// Wait for one second to allow the sound to play
1 :: second => now;
```
This satisfies all constraints.

One potential issue: If I run this, the program stops immediately after the wait? Yes, `1 :: second => now` suspends the program until that time passes. This effectively "ends" the script, but the audio thread has been sending sound for that duration.

Is it possible the user wants a looping generation? No, "one-second" implies a finite duration.

I will provide the code block and a brief description.

One tiny optimization: `0.0` is a safe value for amp unless specified, but `TriOsc` outputs a sine-like triangle wave, and `dac` plays it. It doesn't need an envelope unless it clips. `TriOsc` output range is usually [-1, 1]. `dac` handles this fine.

Final check:
Language: ChucK
Signal: Triangle wave (TriOsc)
Pitch: Middle C (Std.mtof(60))
Duration: 1 second (1 :: second => now)
Output: DAC (=> dac)

The solution is solid.

I should mention that `Std.mtof(60)` is standard practice.

What if they want to stop the sound after the second?
If I write:
```chuck
TriOsc t => dac;
t.freq(Std.mtof(60));
1 :: second => now;
t => null; // disconnect
```
It's safer, but the prompt didn't explicitly ask to disconnect. The `1 :: second => now` usually implies the intended duration of the script execution. I will stick to the simplest valid version.

Actually, looking at standard ChucK examples, often they use a loop for duration, or just `=> now` to block.
Example from the manual: `SinOsc s => dac; s.freq(440); 1::second => now;`
This is the exact pattern I need.

Result is ready.
...done thinking.

Here is a ChucK program that meets those requirements.

```chuck
// Create a triangle oscillator and connect it directly to the DAC
TriOsc t => dac;

// Set the pitch to Middle C (MIDI note 60)
t.freq(Std.mtof(60));

// Wait for one second to allow the sound to play
1 :: second => now;
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`TriOsc t => dac;`**: This creates a `TriOsc` (Triangle Oscillator) object named `t` and connects it to the global `dac` object (the speakers).
2.  **`t.freq(Std.mtof(60));`**: This sets the frequency of the oscillator. `Std.mtof` converts MIDI note number 60 (Middle C) into the corresponding frequency in Hertz.
3.  **`1 :: second => now;`**: This command tells the program to pause for exactly one second. During this pause, the oscillator continues to output sound, creating a continuous one-second triangle wave.
