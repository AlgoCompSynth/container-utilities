   Here is an example of how you can use the `data.table` package in R to read a CSV file into a data.table:
```
library(data.table)
offices <- fread("offices.csv")
```
This will create a data.table called "offices" containing the data from the "offices.csv" file. The `fread()` function is similar to the `read.csv()` function, but it is much faster and more efficient for large datasets.

You can also specify additional arguments to `fread()` to control how the data is read in. For example, you can use the `header` argument to specify that the first row of the CSV file contains column names:
```
offices <- fread("offices.csv", header = TRUE)
```
You can also use the `sep` argument to specify a different separator character (the default is a comma):
```
offices <- fread("offices.csv", sep = "\t")
```
These are just a few examples of how you can use the `data.table` package in R to read a CSV file into a data.table. There are many other options and arguments that you can use to customize the reading process.
