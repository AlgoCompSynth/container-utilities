Okay, I need to write an R program using data.table to perform some tasks. Let me break down what's required step by step.

First, the user wants to read two CSV files: offices.csv and homes.csv. Each of these has two text columns. For offices.csv, the columns are 'employee_id' and 'work_address'. For homes.csv, they're 'employee_id' and 'home_address'. So I'll need to use data.table's fread function to read these into data.tables named 'offices' and 'homes'.

Next, I have to join these two tables on the 'employee_id' column. The result should only include rows where the employee exists in both tables, meaning we're looking for an inner join. Using data.table, this can be done with the merge function or by using the syntax offices[homes, ...], but I think using merge is more straightforward here.

The output columns should be 'employee_id', 'work_address', and 'home_address'. So after joining, I'll need to make sure these three columns are present. It's possible that if there are extra columns from one of the tables, they might not be included by default in a join, but since both have only two columns each, this shouldn't be an issue.

Once the joined data.table is created, it needs to be written to 'result.csv'. I'll use the fwrite function for this, ensuring that the output file includes all necessary columns and rows.

I should also consider whether there are any duplicates or multiple entries for a single employee_id. The problem statement doesn't mention handling that, so I assume each employee appears once in each table. If not, the join would include all combinations, but since we're just joining on the key, it's up to the user to handle duplicates if necessary.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the code by first reading both files, then performing an inner join, and finally writing the result. I'll make sure to set the keys for efficient merging, though in this case with small data, it might not be critical but good practice nonetheless.

I should also check if the CSVs have headers. If they do, fread will automatically read them as column names. If not, I might need to specify the column names in fread, but since the user provided the column names, I'll assume the files include headers.

Finally, testing the code with sample data would be a good idea to ensure it works as expected. That way, if there are any issues with missing columns or incorrect joins, they can be caught early.

Here's an R program using data.table that performs the tasks you described:

```R
# Load the data.table package
library(data.table)

# Read 'offices.csv' into a data.table called 'offices'
offices <- fread("offices.csv", sep = ",")

# Read 'homes.csv' into a data.table called 'homes'
homes <- fread("homes.csv", sep = ",")

# Join the two tables on 'employee_id' and create the result table
result <- merge(offices, homes, by = "employee_id")

# The merged table will only contain rows where 'employee_id' exists in both tables

# Write the result to 'result.csv'
fwrite(result, file = "result.csv", sep = ",")
```

### Explanation:
1. **Reading Data**: The `fread()` function from data.table is used to read the CSV files into data.tables. This function is fast and efficient for reading large datasets.

2. **Joining Tables**: The `merge()` function is used to join the two tables on the 'employee_id' column. By default, `merge()` performs an inner join, which means only rows with matching 'employee_id's will be included in the result.

3. **Writing Output**: The `fwrite()` function writes the resulting data.table to a CSV file named 'result.csv'.

### Notes:
- If you need to handle missing values or different column separators (though I assume comma-separated), you can adjust the parameters of `fread()` and `fwrite()` accordingly.
- Make sure that both input files ('offices.csv' and 'homes.csv') are in your working directory, or provide the full path to these files if they're located elsewhere.
