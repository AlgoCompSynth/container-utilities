Okay, the user asked for an R program using data.table to read a CSV file named 'offices.csv' and store it in a data.table called 'offices'. 

First, I know that data.table is a powerful package in R for handling large datasets. So, I should start by loading the data.table library.

Next, I need to set the working directory so that R can find the CSV file. The user might not be familiar with this step, so I'll include an example using setwd() and comment that they should replace it with their actual path.

Reading the CSV file is straightforward with fread(). I'll use the read.csv2 function from data.table because it's efficient for large files. I'll specify the header parameter to ensure the first row is treated as headers, and na.strings to handle any missing values properly.

After reading the data, I should convert it into a data.table using as.data.table(), which makes it easier to work with if it's not already in that format.

Finally, I'll include some lines to print the dimensions of the dataset and display the first few rows so the user can verify everything loaded correctly. This helps in debugging any issues related to file reading or column structure.

I should make sure the code is clear and well-commented so the user understands each step. Also, I'll remind them to check their working directory if they encounter any path-related errors.

Here's an R program using data.table to read a CSV file named 'offices.csv' into a data.table called 'offices':

```R
# Load the data.table library
library(data.table)

# Set your working directory (replace with your actual path)
setwd("C:/your/path/here")

# Read the CSV file into a data.table
offices <- fread("offices.csv", header = TRUE, na.strings = "")

# Convert to data.table (if it's not already one)
offices <- as.data.table(offices)

# Print the dimensions of the dataset
print(dimensions(offices))

# Display the first few rows of the data.table
head(offices)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Loading the Library**: The `library(data.table)` command loads the data.table package, which provides efficient data handling capabilities.

2. **Setting Working Directory**: The `setwd()` function sets your working directory to where the 'offices.csv' file is located. Replace "C:/your/path/here" with the actual path on your system.

3. **Reading CSV File**: The `fread()` function from the data.table package reads the CSV file into a data.table object called `offices`. 
   - `header = TRUE` specifies that the first row of the CSV contains headers.
   - `na.strings = ""` handles missing values by converting empty fields to NA.

4. **Converting to Data.Table**: The `as.data.table()` function ensures the data is in a data.table format, which is useful for efficient operations on large datasets.

5. **Viewing Dimensions**: The `dim()` or `dimensions()` functions show the dimensions of the dataset (number of rows and columns).

6. **Displaying First Rows**: The `head()` function displays the first few rows of the data.table to verify the data has been read correctly.

Make sure that:
- The file 'offices.csv' exists in your working directory.
- You have the correct permissions to access the file.
