```R
library(data.table)

# 1. Read offices data
offices <- fread("offices.csv")

# 2. Read homes data
homes <- fread("homes.csv")

# 3. Join offices and homes by employee_id
result <- offices[homes, on = "employee_id"]

# 4. Write joined table to file
fwrite(result, "result.csv")
```
In this example, we use the `data.table` package to perform a join operation on two data tables based on a common column. The resulting joined table is written to a CSV file named 'result.csv'.
