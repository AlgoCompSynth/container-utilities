Thinking...
We are going to read the CSV file 'offices.csv' into a data.table named 'offices'
 Steps:
 1. Load the data.table package (if not already loaded).
 2. Use fread() from data.table to read the CSV file.

 Note: The problem does not specify the structure of the CSV, so we assume it's a standard CSV.
 We are to read it into a data.table called 'offices'.

 However, note that the problem does not specify any particular columns or data types, so we just read the file.

 Important: The file name is 'offices.csv'. We assume it's in the current working directory.

 Let's write the code accordingly.
...done thinking.

Here's the concise R program using `data.table` to read the CSV file:

```r
# Load data.table package (if not already loaded)
library(data.table)

# Read CSV file into a data.table named 'offices'
offices <- fread("offices.csv")
```

**Key points explained:**
1. `library(data.table)` - Ensures the `data.table` package is loaded (required for `fread()`)
2. `fread("offices.csv")` - Reads the CSV file directly into a data.table object
   - Automatically infers data types (integers, doubles, character)
   - Handles missing values efficiently
   - Uses fast C-level operations for performance
   - Preserves column order from the CSV
3. The resulting `offices` object is a data.table with the same structure as the CSV file

**Important notes:**
- This assumes `offices.csv` is in your current working directory
- Works with standard CSV format (comma-separated, no header row if specified by `header=FALSE`)
- Handles large files efficiently due to `data.table`'s optimized reading
- No need for manual column specification or data conversion

**Example usage after reading:**
```r
# View first 3 rows
head(offices, 3)

# Check structure
str(offices)

# Count rows
nrow(offices)
```
