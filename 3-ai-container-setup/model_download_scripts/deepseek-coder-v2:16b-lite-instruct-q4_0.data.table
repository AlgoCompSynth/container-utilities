 Certainly! Below is an example of how you can use the `data.table` package in R to read a CSV file named `offices.csv` and store it in a data.table called `offices`.

First, make sure you have the `data.table` package installed. If not, you can install it using:

```R
install.packages("data.table")
```

Now, you can use the following R script to read the CSV file into a data.table:

```R
# Load the data.table package
library(data.table)

# Read the CSV file into a data.table
offices <- fread('offices.csv')

# Print the first few rows of the data.table to verify
print(head(offices))
```

Here's a breakdown of what this script does:
1. Loads the `data.table` package using the `library()` function.
2. Uses the `fread()` function from the `data.table` package to read the CSV file named `offices.csv` into a data.table called `offices`.
3. Prints the first few rows of the data.table to ensure that the data has been successfully loaded.

Make sure your working directory contains the `offices.csv` file, or provide the full path to the file in the `fread()` function if it's located elsewhere.
