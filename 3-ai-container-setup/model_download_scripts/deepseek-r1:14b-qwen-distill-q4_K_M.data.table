Thinking...
Okay, I need to help the user write an R program using data.table to read a CSV file named 'offices.csv' into a data.table called 'offices'. 

First, I should remember that data.table is an extension of data.frame and provides efficient handling for large datasets. So, the main steps are loading the data.table package and then reading the CSV.

I'll start by mentioning that the user needs to ensure the CSV file is in the correct directory or specify the full path if it's elsewhere. That way, they avoid any issues with file location.

Next, I'll outline the code step-by-step. First, loading data.table with library(data.table). Then, using fread() function to read the CSV. The code would be something like offices <- fread('offices.csv').

I should also include an example of printing the first few rows using head(offices) so the user can verify the data is loaded correctly.

Additionally, it might be helpful to provide options for handling different scenarios, like if the CSV has headers or if there are issues with encoding. I'll mention that by default, fread looks for headers, but they can specify them explicitly if needed. Also, offering a way to convert columns to factors based on their data types could add more utility.

Finally, I should keep the explanation clear and concise, making sure each step is understandable without assuming too much prior knowledge.
...done thinking.

To read a CSV file into a `data.table` in R, you can use the `fread()` function from the `data.table` package. Here's how you can do it:

1. First, make sure you have the `data.table` package installed and loaded.

2. Use the `fread()` function to read your CSV file into a `data.table`.

Here is the complete code:

```r
# Load the data.table package
library(data.table)

# Read the CSV file into a data.table called 'offices'
offices <- fread('offices.csv')

# You can view the first few rows of the data.table to verify it's loaded correctly
head(offices)
```

### Explanation:
- `library(data.table)`: Loads the `data.table` package.
- `fread('offices.csv')`: Reads the CSV file into a `data.table` object called `offices`.
- `head(offices)`: Displays the first few rows of the data table to verify the data is loaded correctly.

If you need any additional processing or if the CSV has specific headers or encodings, let me know and I can help further!
