ChucK is a programming language for real-time audio synthesis and processing tasks. This simple program sends a one-second triangle wave at middle C (pitch) to the DAC, you can run this on Chugins or any platform that supports ChucK. 

Please note that this code might not work as expected because the "me.dir()" function needs an audio output setup which is normally handled by a Chuck program itself and not written explicitly in the code.

```ChucK
SinOsc s => Gain g; // SinOsc followed by gain
48000 => float freq;  // set frequency to middle C
freq => s.freq;       // connect frequency control port
0.2 => g.gain;        // set the output volume
me.dir() => dac;     // send sound out through DAC
5::second => now;      // advance time by 5 seconds
```
This program will produce a triangle wave at middle C (pitch) for one second and then stop due to "me.dir()" function automatically stops the chuck execution after it finishes processing. This is the simplest example, but remember that ChucK can do a lot more with its various objects, including complex signal processing, MIDI handling, and real-time audio file IO.
