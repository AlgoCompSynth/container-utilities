The I2S format for the DAC is shown in the figure below:

The audio output of the DAC is connected to a speaker in series with a 100uF
capacitor and a resistor (300 Ohms or so) in parallel. The purpose of this
resistor is to limit current draw from the capacitor when the power supply
is turned off. This technique is called **resistive flyback**.
