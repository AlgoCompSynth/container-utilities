Thinking...
Alright, the user has asked me to write an R program that uses data.table to read a CSV file named 'offices.csv' into a data.table called 'offices'. 

First, I need to make sure that the user is aware of the necessary steps. They'll need to install and load both the data.table and readr packages because readr has a fast csv reading function.

I should explain each step clearly. Start by checking if the packages are installed. If not, use install.packages(). Then, load them with library().

Next, I need to address where the CSV file is located. It's important to tell the user that they might need to adjust the file path depending on their system and whether the file is in their working directory or elsewhere.

I should write the code using fread() from data.table since it's efficient for reading large files. After loading, assigning it to 'offices' makes sense.

Including a note about checking the data with summary() would help them verify that everything loaded correctly. Maybe also mention that they can use other functions if needed.

I should keep the explanation straightforward without assuming too much prior knowledge. Make sure each step is clear and concise so they can follow along easily.
...done thinking.

Certainly! Below is an R program using `data.table` to read a CSV file named 'offices.csv' into a data.table called 'offices'.

```R
# Load required libraries
if (!require(data.table)) {
    install.packages("data.table")
    library(data.table)
}
if (!require(readr)) {
    install.packages("readr")
    library(readr)
}

# Read the CSV file into a data.table
offices <- fread('offices.csv')

# Optional: Check the first few rows of the data.table
print(head(offices))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Loading Libraries**: The program first checks if the required libraries (`data.table` and `readr`) are installed and loaded.
2. **Reading CSV File**: The `fread()` function from the `data.table` package is used to read the 'offices.csv' file into a data.table named `offices`.
3. **Checking Data**: An optional step to print the first few rows of the data.table using `head()`, which helps in verifying that the data has been loaded correctly.

Make sure that:
- The CSV file 'offices.csv' is located in your working directory or provide the correct file path.
- You have the necessary permissions to read the file.
- All required packages are installed and up-to-date.
