```r
library(data.table)

# Read the CSV file into a data.table called 'offices'
offices <- fread("offices.csv")
```

This code uses the `fread()` function from the `data.table` package to efficiently read the CSV file named `offices.csv` into a data.table object called `offices`. The `fread()` function is specifically optimized for fast reading of tabular data and is the recommended way to read CSV files when using the `data.table` package.
