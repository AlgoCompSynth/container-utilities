Thinking...
1.  **Analyze the Request:**
    *   **Language:** R.
    *   **Library:** `data.table`.
    *   **Action:** Read a CSV file named 'offices.csv'.
    *   **Output Variable:** `offices` (a `data.table`).

2.  **Identify Key Functions:**
    *   The primary function for reading data in `data.table` is `fread()` (fast read).

3.  **Formulate the Code:**

    *   *Step 1: Load the library.*
        `library(data.table)`

    *   *Step 2: Read the file.*
        `offices <- fread("offices.csv")`

4.  **Review and Refine:**
    *   Does the code meet all requirements? Yes.
    *   Is `fread` preferred over `data.table(..., fread=TRUE)`? Yes, `fread` is the idiomatic way.
    *   Should I handle file paths or just the filename? The prompt says 'offices.csv', so just the filename is appropriate.

5.  **Construct the Final Output:**
    *   Provide the code block.
    *   Add a brief explanation.

    *Drafting the response:*
    ```R
    library(data.table)

    # Read the CSV file into a data.table named 'offices'
    offices <- fread("offices.csv")
    ```

6.  **Final Polish:** The request is simple and direct. The solution should be equally direct.

    ```R
    # Load the data.table library
    library(data.table)

    # Read the CSV file into a data.table
    offices <- fread("offices.csv")
    ```

7.  **Final Output Generation.** (Matches the thought process above).
...done thinking.

```R
library(data.table)

# Read the CSV file into a data.table
offices <- fread("offices.csv")
```
