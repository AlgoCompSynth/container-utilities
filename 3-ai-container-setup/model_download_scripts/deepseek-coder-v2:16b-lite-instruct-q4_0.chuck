 Certainly! Below is a ChucK program that generates a one-second triangle wave at the pitch of middle C and sends it to the DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter).

```chuck
// Define the sample rate (44100 Hz is standard)
const sampRate = 44100.0;

// Define the frequency for middle C (261.63 Hz)
const freqMiddleC = 261.63;

// Create a triangle wave oscillator
Osc osc => dac; // Connect the oscillator to the DAC
osc.gain(0.5);   // Set the gain to control the volume
osc.freq(freqMiddleC); // Set the frequency to middle C

// Generate the signal for one second
for (int i = 0; i < sampRate * 1; i++) {
    osc.next(); // Trigger the oscillator to generate the next sample
}
```

This ChucK program sets up an oscillator that generates a triangle wave at the frequency of middle C and connects it directly to the DAC for audio output. The `osc` object is configured with a gain of 0.5, which controls the volume of the sound, and the oscillator's frequency is set to 261.63 Hz, corresponding to middle C.

To run this program, you would typically save it as a `.ck` file and then execute it using the ChucK interpreter on your computer or another platform that supports ChucK.
