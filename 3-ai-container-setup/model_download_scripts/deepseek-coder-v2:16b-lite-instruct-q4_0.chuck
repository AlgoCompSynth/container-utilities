 Certainly! Below is a simple ChucK program that generates a one-second long triangle wave with the frequency corresponding to middle C (approximately 261.63 Hz) and sends it to the DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter).

```chuck
// Define the frequency for middle C
float freq = 261.63;

// Create a sine oscillator at the desired frequency
Osc osc => LPF lpf => Pan2 pan => dac; // Connect the oscillator to a low-pass filter and then to a stereo panner, which is connected to the DAC
osc.freq(freq); // Set the frequency of the oscillator
osc.gain(0.5); // Set the gain (volume) of the oscillator
lpf.freq(10000); // Set the cutoff frequency of the low-pass filter to allow higher harmonics
lpf.Q(1); // Set the Q factor for the low-pass filter
pan.gain(0.5, 0.5); // Pan the sound slightly left and right

// Play the oscillator for one second
1::second => now;
```

This program does the following:
1. Defines the frequency corresponding to middle C (261.63 Hz).
2. Creates an `Osc`illator that generates a sine wave at this frequency.
3. Connects the oscillator to a low-pass filter (`LPF`) and then to a stereo panner (`Pan2`), which is connected to the DAC (`dac`).
4. Sets the frequency of the oscillator to middle C.
5. Sets the gain (volume) of the oscillator to 0.5.
6. Sets the cutoff frequency of the low-pass filter to allow higher harmonics and sets its Q factor.
7. Pans the sound slightly left and right using the `Pan2` effect.
8. Plays the oscillator for one second (`1::second => now;`).

You can run this program in a ChucK environment or online compiler that supports ChucK code execution.
