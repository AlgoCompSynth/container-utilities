Thinking...
Okay, so I need to write a Chuck program that sends a one-second triangle wave at middle C to the DAC. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, what's a triangle wave? I remember it's a type of waveform that has a linear rise and fall, creating a more "natural" sound compared to square waves. It's often used in synthesis because it's rich in harmonics.

Middle C is the note C4 in music notation. I think its frequency is around 261.63 Hz. So my program needs to generate a triangle wave at that frequency.

Chuck uses a unit called 'dac' for digital-to-analog conversion, so I'll need to route the signal through dac. The duration should be one second, so the code should run for 1000 milliseconds.

How do I create a triangle oscillator in Chuck? I recall there are different types of oscillators: sinOsc for sine waves, triOsc for triangle, and others. So I can use triOsc to get the triangle wave.

Putting it together: I'll initialize a triOsc with the frequency 261.63. Then connect it to dac. Finally, set the duration to one second using 1::second. 

Wait, do I need to specify the amplitude? The default might be too quiet or too loud. Maybe setting it to 0.5 would make it a moderate volume.

So the code structure should be:

- Create triOsc named c.
- Set its frequency to 261.63.
- Connect to dac with some gain, maybe 0.5.
- Run for one second.

Let me think if there's anything else. Oh, I should probably include the necessary headers or not? In Chuck, I don't need to include anything extra unless using specific libraries, which I'm not here.

So putting it all together:

Initialize the oscillator with frequency. Connect it through a gain and then to dac. Set the duration. That's it!
...done thinking.

To create a ChucK program that generates a one-second triangle wave at middle C (261.63 Hz) and sends it to the DAC, follow these steps:

1. **Create an Oscillator**: Use `triOsc` for a triangle wave.
2. **Set Frequency**: Middle C is 261.63 Hz.
3. **Route to DAC**: Connect the oscillator to `dac`.
4. **Adjust Amplitude (Optional)**: Set a moderate volume, e.g., 0.5.
5. **Run for One Second**: Use `1::second` as duration.

Here's the code:

```chuck
// Initialize a triangle wave oscillator at middle C
triOsc c => gain g => dac;
c.freq(261.63);
g.gain = 0.5; // Optional: Adjust volume

// Run for one second
while (true) {
    if (now >= 1::second) break;
}
```

**Explanation**:

- `triOsc c` creates a triangle oscillator.
- `c.freq(261.63)` sets the frequency to middle C.
- `gain g => dac` connects the oscillator through a gain control to the DAC for output.
- `g.gain = 0.5` adjusts the volume (optional).
- The loop runs until one second has passed, then exits.

**Note**: Ensure your audio interface is set up correctly in Chuck to hear the sound.
