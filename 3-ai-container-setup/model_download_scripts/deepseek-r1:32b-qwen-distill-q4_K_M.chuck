Thinking...
Okay, so I need to help this user write a Chuck program that sends a one-second triangle wave at middle C to the DAC. Hmm, let me start by recalling what Chuck is. It's a programming language for real-time audio and music creation. So, I should structure the code accordingly.

First, I remember that in Chuck, you typically use UGen (unit generators) for sound synthesis. For a triangle wave, the TriOsc UGen is appropriate. Middle C is 261.63 Hz, so I'll set the frequency there.

I need to create a TriOsc object and connect it to the DAC. The DAC in Chuck usually has two channels, left and right. So, I should route the output of the oscillator to both dac.left and dac.right to make sure sound plays through both speakers.

Now, about timing. The program needs to run for one second. In Chuck, time is managed with the now + 1s expression. But since we're dealing with real-time audio, it's better to use a loop that runs until the specified duration has passed.

I should set up an initial time, say t0, and then have a while loop that continues as long as the current time minus t0 is less than 1 second. Inside the loop, I'll continually generate samples of the triangle wave.

Wait, but how does Chuck handle sample rates? Oh right, by default, Chuck uses 44.1 kHz, which should be fine for this purpose. So each iteration of the loop will process one sample at a time, updating the output for both DAC channels.

Putting it all together: Initialize t0 with now to mark the start time. Create the TriOsc object with the correct frequency. Enter a loop that runs until one second has elapsed, updating the oscillator and DAC each cycle.

Let me think if there's anything else. Maybe adding a small delay at the end to ensure all samples are processed before exiting? Or perhaps Chuck handles that automatically since it's designed for real-time processing.

I should also mention that when running the code, the user might need to have their audio interface set up properly so that sound is output correctly. That way, they can verify that the program works as intended.
...done thinking.

Certainly! Below is a ChucK program that generates and sends a one-second triangle wave at middle C (C4) to the DAC.

```chuck
// Initialize the time variable
t0 = now;

// Create a triangle oscillator
TriOsc tri => dac;
tri.freq(261.63); // Middle C frequency in Hz

// Run for 1 second
while (now - t0 < 1s) {
    // Continuously generate samples
}
```

### Explanation:
- `t0 = now;`: This line captures the current time when the program starts running.
- `TriOsc tri => dac;`: This creates a triangle wave oscillator and connects it to the DAC (digital-to-analog converter).
- `tri.freq(261.63);`: Sets the frequency of the triangle wave to middle C (C4), which is 261.63 Hz.
- The `while` loop runs for one second (`now - t0 < 1s`) and continuously generates samples, ensuring that the sound plays for exactly one second.

To run this program:
1. Save it with a `.ck` extension (e.g., `triangle_wave.ck`).
2. Open ChucK and load the file using the `-f` flag:  
   ```bash
   chuck -f triangle_wave.ck
   ```
3. You should hear a one-second triangle wave at middle C through your DAC.

Make sure your audio interface is properly configured, and you may need to adjust permissions or settings depending on your system.
