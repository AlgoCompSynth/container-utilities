Thinking...
The user wants a ChucK program that sends a one-second middle C triangle wave to the DAC. So we need to write a ChucK program code. Should mention the frequency of middle C, which is 261.63 Hz (or approximate). Use the triangle wave oscillator, maybe TriOsc or something like that. In ChucK, you can use TriOsc or a TriangleOsc or something. There's a built-in TriangleOsc. We can set frequency, duration, and connect to dac. Should use a duration of 1 second. Use the "->" to connect to dac. Something like:

```
TriOsc myTri => dac;
myTri.freq(261.63);
now => myTri.setPos(0);
1::second => now;
```

But to make it 1-second only, we can use 1::second => now, or maybe use dur dur = 1::second; dur => now; Actually, we can use 1::second => now to jump forward by one second. But we want to play for one second. In ChucK, we can do something like:

```
TriOsc tri => dac;
tri.freq(261.63);
1::second => now;
```

But that would just play the waveform from time zero to one second? Actually, by default, the oscillator will produce output until program terminates. We need to set the program to stop after 1 second. One can use `now + 1::second => now;` or `1::second => now;` Wait, if you set `1::second => now;`, you skip time forward by 1 second; but the program will still be running. It will produce output until the program ends. If you don't end the program, it will continue. So we need to schedule the program to stop after 1 second. In ChucK, you can use the `now` variable and do `now + 1::second => now;` and then maybe `stop();`? But better is to do:

```
TriOsc tri => dac;
tri.freq(261.63);
now => time start;
while (now - start < 1::second) {
    1::ms => now;
}
me.stop(); // or just end program
```

But we can also do: `TriOsc tri => dac; tri.freq(261.63); 1::second => now; me.stop();` But I'm not sure if me.stop() is used. Another approach: Use a "fun void playTri(){ ... }" with `now += 1::second;` then exit. But maybe we can just set `1::second => now;` and then `me.stop();` The program ends after the last line. But I think we can simply do:

```
TriOsc tri => dac;
tri.freq(261.63);
1::second => now;
```

And the program will exit after that line because it's the last statement. But I'm not entirely sure if this will cause the triangle to play for 1 second. In ChucK, `now` is a global variable representing current time. When you set `now` to something, the program's time jumps forward. But the audio engine will still be producing audio. Usually, we write:

```
TriOsc tri => dac;
tri.freq(261.63);
1::second => now; // this will cause the program to advance by 1 second and then exit
```

But I think to get the audio output, we might need to specify a `now => dur`? Let's think: In a typical ChucK program to play a 1-second tone, we might do:

```
SinOsc s => dac;
s.freq(440);
1::second => now;
```

Yes, that works. The program will start at time 0, produce the sine wave, then after 1 second the time jumps forward and the program exits, causing the audio to stop. That is standard.

Thus for triangle wave, we can use `TriOsc`:

```
TriOsc tri => dac;
tri.freq(261.63);
1::second => now;
```

But also need to set amplitude maybe to something like 0.5. The default amplitude is 0.5? In TriOsc, amplitude default is 0.5 I think. We can set `tri.gain(0.5);`. But not necessary.

Thus final code:

```
TriOsc tri => dac;
tri.freq(261.63); // Middle C
tri.gain(0.5);    // optional
1::second => now;
```

We might also comment the code.

Better: Use `1::second => now;` and then maybe `me.stop();` but it's not needed.

Thus answer: Provide a small program with comments.

Also note that "TriangleOsc" may be used: In ChucK 2.0, there's TriOsc. We'll provide code.

Thus in final answer, show full program. Also mention how to run: compile and run.

Thus I'll provide the code and a brief explanation.

Ok.
...done thinking.

Below is a minimal, self‑contained ChucK script that will output a **one‑second triangle‑wave burst of middle‑C (≈261.63 Hz)** to the default DAC.  
Save it as, for example, `middle_c_triangle.ck` and run it with `chuck middle_c_triangle.ck`.

```chuck
// -------------------------------------------------
// middle_c_triangle.ck
// Send a one‑second middle‑C triangle wave to the DAC
// -------------------------------------------------

TriOsc tri => dac;          // Triangle‑wave oscillator
tri.freq(261.63);           // Middle‑C (A4 = 440 Hz, C4 ≈ 261.63 Hz)
tri.gain(0.5);              // Optional: set amplitude to half the maximum

1::second => now;           // Advance the program clock by 1 second
                            // (the program ends here, so the audio stops)
```

### How it works

1. **`TriOsc tri => dac;`**  
   Creates a triangle‑wave oscillator (`TriOsc`) and connects its output directly to the system DAC.

2. **`tri.freq(261.63);`**  
   Sets the oscillator’s frequency to middle‑C (≈261.63 Hz).  
   (You can tweak the number if you prefer a different tuning.)

3. **`tri.gain(0.5);`**  
   Optionally scales the amplitude so the output isn’t clipping.  
   The default gain is 0.5, so you can remove this line if you like.

4. **`1::second => now;`**  
   The `now` variable is ChucK’s global time.  
   Assigning a duration to it advances the clock by that amount.  
   After this line, the script has nothing left to execute, so the program terminates, and the audio stops—exactly one second after it starts.

That’s all you need! Feel free to experiment with other waveforms (`SinOsc`, `SawOsc`, etc.) or frequencies.
