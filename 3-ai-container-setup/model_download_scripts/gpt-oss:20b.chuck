Thinking...
We need to write a ChucK program that sends a 1-second triangle wave at pitch middle C to the DAC. ChucK language: "dac" is a standard output. Need to generate triangle wave: use "Oscillator" or "tri" function? I recall ChucK has "tri" as a waveform? Actually, "SinOsc" etc. For triangle, we can use "TriOsc" or "tri" method. Let me think: In ChucK, there is a "TriOsc" object? Let me search memory: In ChucK, standard oscillator types: "SinOsc", "SawOsc", "TriOsc", "Noise". There is "TriOsc" I think. But maybe "TriOsc" is a class. For generating a triangle wave: triOsc.oscRate. Actually "TriOsc" has .freq. Or we can use the "tri" function: "tri" in the "synthesizer" or "Ugen"? Wait: There's "tri" Ugen: "Tri" I think is used. But I think the easiest is to use "SinOsc" with a square wave? No. Let's recall: There is "TriOsc" as a type. In code examples: "TriOsc tri => dac;" "tri.freq(440);" "tri.gain(0.5);" "1::second => now;" This would output one second. But need pitch middle C: that is 261.63 Hz. So "tri.freq(261.63);" But to be safe we can compute from MIDI note number. In ChucK, you can use "midicps(noteNumber)". So "midicps(60)" is middle C (60). So we can do "tri.freq(midicps(60));" That will be about 261.63.

Also, we need to set the gain, maybe 0.5. And output to DAC. The "dac" is a sink: "TriOsc tri => dac;" That will route the output. Then "1::second => now;" then "0 => now;" or just let program exit. But we need to send one second. So code:

TriOsc tri => dac;
tri.freq(midicps(60));
tri.gain(0.5);
1::second => now;

That's the whole program.

Alternatively, we can do:

TriOsc tri => dac;
tri.freq(261.63);
tri.gain(0.5);
1::second => now;

Also, we might want to set "tri" to "tri" for triangle wave. There's also "SqrOsc" for square wave. But anyway.

So answer: Provide ChucK program snippet.

Also, mention that you need to compile with "chuck -q program.ck" etc. Provide full code.

We'll answer with full program. Maybe show how to use "TriOsc tri => dac;" or "tri => dac" etc.

We can include comments. Let's produce answer accordingly.

We need to be sure it's a valid ChucK program. The standard "=> dac" sends to DAC.

Thus:

TriOsc tri => dac;
tri.freq(midicps(60));
tri.gain(0.5);
1::second => now;

That's it. Alternatively, if we want to use "TriOsc" we need to import? But it's part of core. So fine.

Hence answer.
...done thinking.

Below is a minimal, self‑contained ChucK program that:

* builds a triangle‑wave oscillator,
* sets its frequency to middle‑C (MIDI 60 → 261.63 Hz),
* routes the sound straight to the system DAC,
* plays the waveform for exactly one second and then exits.

```chuck
// --------------------------------------------------
// 1‑second triangle wave at Middle C (MIDI 60)
// --------------------------------------------------

// Create a triangle‑wave oscillator
TriOsc tri => dac;

// Set the oscillator frequency to middle C
tri.freq( midicps(60) );   // midicps(60) ≈ 261.63 Hz

// Optional: set a comfortable output level (0.0 – 1.0)
tri.gain( 0.5 );

// Play for one second
1::second => now;

// (Program ends automatically after the above delay)
```

**How to run**

```bash
chuck triangle_midC.ck
```

The program will output a one‑second triangle wave at the middle‑C pitch through your default audio output device.
