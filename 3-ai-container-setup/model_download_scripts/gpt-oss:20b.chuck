Thinking...
We need to write a ChucK program. It should send a one-second triangle wave at pitch middle C to the DAC. So we need to generate a triangle wave at 261.626 Hz (middle C). We need to generate for 1 second. In ChucK, we can set up a oscillator. There's a TriOsc for triangle wave. Actually ChucK has the TriOsc class for triangle wave. We can set freq, amp. For 1 second: use me.time or 1::second. Use a control to stop after 1 second. For example: tri.freq(261.626); tri.amp(0.5); tri => dac; after 1::second => me.exit(); or use 1::second => now; etc. Or simpler: tri => dac; 1::second => now; tri => dac; or you can use 1::second => me.pause(); tri => dac; after 1 second maybe just kill the thread. We need to be careful: after the program runs, we need to stop. Use "me.exit()" after 1 second. Or use "1::second => now; me.exit();" Should work. Or "me.sleep(1::second)"? There's no sleep, but can do "1::second => now;". Let's write:

// set up triangle oscillator
TriOsc tri => dac;
tri.freq(261.626);
tri.amp(0.5);

// play for 1 second
1::second => now;

// exit program
me.exit();

That's it. Or could use 1::second => me.pause(); but exit is fine.

We need to ensure it's one-second triangle wave. Also we could use "TriOsc" which uses a triangle wave. Or maybe we want a "TriOsc" or "TriOsc" (Triangular oscillator). Alternatively, we could use "TriOsc" or "TriOsc" which is correct. Let’s confirm the class name: In ChucK, there is "TriOsc" for triangle wave. Yes, there is "TriOsc". Example: TriOsc tri => dac; tri.freq(440); tri.amp(0.5); etc.

We should also mention that the default DAC uses a sample rate of 44.1 kHz. Also that we may need to set the sample rate or ensure it's correct. But not necessary for simple program.

Write full program. Also include comments.

Make sure it's correct syntax. ChucK uses "=>" to connect objects. Use "=> dac" etc. "dac" is a built-in audio output. Use "TriOsc" as an oscillator.

Thus the code:

TriOsc tri => dac;
tri.freq(261.626);
tri.amp(0.5);
1::second => now;
me.exit();

Alternatively, we could include "TriOsc" to "dac" and then "tri => dac" but we did "tri => dac". But order: "tri => dac;" is correct. The direction is from oscillator to DAC. But typical usage: TriOsc tri => dac; That is correct: tri is source, dac is sink. So TriOsc tri => dac.

Alternatively we might want "tri => dac;" after connecting? Actually the syntax "tri => dac;" is the same as "tri => dac;" is correct. But we can write "TriOsc tri => dac;" which is also correct.

Thus final code:

TriOsc tri => dac;
tri.freq(261.626);
tri.amp(0.5);
1::second => now;
me.exit();

Alternatively we could use "tri => dac;" after specifying freq and amp. Both fine.

Also we can set "tri => dac" before setting freq, but not important.

Make sure to include the program in triple backticks.

We should mention the amplitude is 0.5 to avoid clipping. Or we can set amplitude to 0.25. But 0.5 is fine.

Thus final answer: Provide the code snippet. We'll add some comments explaining steps.

Let's produce the final answer.
...done thinking.

Below is a minimal ChucK script that plays a one‑second triangle wave at middle‑C (≈ 261.63 Hz) to the default DAC.  
The `TriOsc` object generates a triangle waveform, we set its frequency and amplitude, connect it to the DAC, then pause the thread for one second before exiting.

```chuck
// -------------------------------------------------------------
// One‑second triangle wave at middle‑C
// -------------------------------------------------------------

// Create a triangle oscillator and connect it to the DAC
TriOsc tri => dac;

// Set the oscillator frequency to middle C (≈ 261.626 Hz)
tri.freq(261.626);

// Set a safe amplitude (0.0 – 1.0)
tri.amp(0.5);

// Wait for 1 second
1::second => now;

// Stop the program
me.exit();
```

**How it works**

1. `TriOsc tri => dac;` – instantiates a triangle oscillator and connects its output to the digital‑to‑analog converter.  
2. `tri.freq(261.626);` – sets the pitch to middle‑C.  
3. `tri.amp(0.5);` – limits the amplitude to half the maximum to avoid clipping.  
4. `1::second => now;` – suspends the current thread for one second, letting the oscillator play.  
5. `me.exit();` – terminates the program after the delay.  

Save this as, e.g., `middleC.chuck` and run it with the ChucK interpreter (`chuck middleC.chuck`). You should hear a single second of a clean triangle wave at middle‑C.
