Thinking...
We are going to read the CSV file 'offices.csv' into a data.table named 'offices'
 Steps:
 1. Load the data.table package (if not already loaded)
 2. Use fread() from data.table to read the CSV file

 Note: The problem does not specify the directory, so we assume the file is in the current working directory.
 We'll write the code accordingly.

 However, note: The problem does not specify whether the data has a header or not. 
 Typically, if the problem says "read a csv file", it is assumed to have a header unless stated otherwise.

 But to be safe, we might check the problem statement. It doesn't specify, so we assume it does have a header.

 Let's write the code accordingly.
...done thinking.

Here's the R program using `data.table` to read the CSV file `offices.csv` into a data.table named `offices`:

```r
# Load the data.table package
library(data.table)

# Read the CSV file into a data.table named 'offices'
offices <- fread("offices.csv")

# Optional: Verify the result (if needed)
print(offices)
```

### Explanation:
1. **`library(data.table)`**: Loads the `data.table` package which provides the `fread()` function for fast data import.
2. **`fread("offices.csv")`**: 
   - Reads the CSV file `offices.csv` from the current working directory
   - Automatically infers data types (integers, doubles, characters)
   - Handles large datasets efficiently
   - Uses columnar processing for speed
   - Preserves the original column names and order
3. **Result**: The data is stored in a `data.table` object named `offices`, which inherits all `data.frame` functionality plus optimized operations.

### Key Features of `fread()`:
- **Faster than `read.csv()`**: Up to 100x faster for large datasets
- **Memory efficient**: Processes data in chunks
- **Automatic data type detection**: Better for performance than manual specification
- **Handles special characters**: Properly manages quotes, commas, and delimiters

> **Note**: If your CSV has:
> - A header row → `fread()` automatically uses it as column names
> - No header → Add `header = FALSE` (not needed here as standard)
> - Special delimiters → Use `sep = "something"` (default is comma)

This solution meets the requirement exactly by:
1. Using `data.table`
2. Creating a data.table named `offices`
3. Reading from `offices.csv` in the standard working directory
