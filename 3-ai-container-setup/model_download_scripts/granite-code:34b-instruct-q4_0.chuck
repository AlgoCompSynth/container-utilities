// Example 1: Send a one second triangle wave at pitch middle C to the
//           DAC.

// set the fundamental frequency of the triangle wave
float fundamental = MiddleC;

// send a noteOn message to the synth ugen and immediately after
// send a noteOff that will sound for a duration of 1 second
// notice that the duration is not set by the time to execute this code,
// but rather by how long it takes the synth to generate the sound
noteOn(fundamental);
sleep(1.0);
noteOff();
